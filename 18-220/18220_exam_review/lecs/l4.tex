\subsection*{Lecture 4}
More MOSFETs and their applications.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Why do we say a MOSFET behaves like a VCCS (voltage-controlled current source)
  in saturation?
  \item What imperfection in saturation do nanoscale MOSFETs suffer from?
  \item Explain how we get gain from a MOSFET, and what region we have to be in.
  Extra: why does the other region not work for gain?
  \item Draw the following digital gates with MOSFETS:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item NOT
    \item OR 
    \item AND 
    \item XOR
  \end{itemize}
  \item Draw a CMOS circuit and explain its advantages to just a MOSFET.

  %% LAB
  \item Why is it useful to to use MOSFETs as switches? For example, in LAB1 we used 
  a MOSFET as switch to turn on the IR LED, but why didn't we just turn a digital out pin ON and OFF instead of 
  having the MOSFET in between?
\end{enumerate}
