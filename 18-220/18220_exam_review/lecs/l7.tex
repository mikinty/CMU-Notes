Inductors, RL circuits, DC regulation.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item How does an inductor store energy?
  \item Solve the following RL circuit, with a step input,

        (-1.5, 1.5) node[left] {$I_1$}
      ;
    \end{circuitikz} 
    \item How does an inductor behave when it is uncharged/charged?
    \item Explain how a DC motor works.
    \item Draw a full-wave rectifier circuit, and explain how it works.
    \item Why do we use capacitors to ``smooth'' our circuit signals?
    \item How is a zener diode different from a diode?
    \item In Lab 2, how is the more efficient regulator different from the initial regulator?
    \item How do we regulate voltage in Lab 2?
    \item Why do we not need to regulate current in Lab 2?
