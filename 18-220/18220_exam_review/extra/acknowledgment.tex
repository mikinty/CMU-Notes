\subsection*{Acknowledgment}
I would like to thank the 18-220 course staff for putting together this great
introduction course to circuits. After TAing this course for 5 semesters,
I've never gotten tired of teaching and relearning the concepts. A lot of the
content from these questions come from the lectures, so I give credit to the
slides.
