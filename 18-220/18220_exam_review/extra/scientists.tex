\subsection*{Scientists}
You will need to know about some scientists for the final.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Alessandro Volta:} first demonstrated electrochemical
  reactions to provide electrical energy.
  \item \textbf{James Watt:} Scottish, patented the steam engine in 1769.
  The unit Watt, electrical and mechanical power, is named after him.
  \item \textbf{Faraday:} showed that a force is produced on a current by a magnetic field.
  \item \textbf{Lenz:} Russian physicist who discovered that current induced
  in a coil du to a magnetic flux change through the coil will always be such
  that it opposes the change that caused it.
  \item \textbf{Fourier:} Found that signals can be decomposed into an infinite sum of sine and cosines.
  \item \textbf{Marconi:} In 1901 held a \SI{200}{m} wire in the air with a
  kite to receive the first radio signal across the Atlantic Ocean
