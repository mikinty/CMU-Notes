# CMU Notes

A collection of notes I'd like to share to the public for some of the classes I've taken at Carnegie Mellon University.
If you spot any typos or revisions, feel free to submit an issue and I'll fix it.

## Organization

I haven't put a whole lot of thought into this, but I think for now,

```text
CLASS
- [NOTE_NAME].pdf
- [NOTE_NAME]/
```

Where `[NOTE_NAME]/` is the directory for the source code of the PDF handout, if it exists.

This is a bit inconvenient because LaTeX compilers will most likely build
within the source code folder. Oh well.
